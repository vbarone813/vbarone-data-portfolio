# Sudoku Solver 

## Overview 
This project is a Python program that solves Sudoku puzzles using a backtracking algorithm. It features a graphic user interphase (GUI) that allows users to input puzzles or randomly generate them and see the solution interactively.

## How It Was Built 
This project was built by following these tutorials from Tech with Tim:
  - Python Sudoku Solver Tutorial with Backtracking p.1 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqUwSA0xI-s)
  - Python Sudoku Solver Tutorial with Backtracking p.2 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK4N8E6uNr4)

The GUI was implemented with **Pygame** to gain experience with Python visuals and interactive graphics, adding a hands-on visual element to the solver. 

## Skills Applied 
- Recursive backtracking algorithm 
- Algorithmic problem-solving 
- GUI development in Python

### File Overview 
- main.py: Entry point of the program; initializes the window and links the solver and GUI.
- solver.py: Contains the recursive backtracking algorithm that solves the Sudoku.
- gui.py: Handles rendering the grid, user interaction, and visual feedback via pygame.
