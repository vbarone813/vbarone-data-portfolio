# Power BI Projects

This folder contains my Power BI projects as a part of my data portfolio. 
These projects reflect my progress through the Microsoft Power BI course on Coursera. 

## Projects: 

- Capstone Project 1: Extract, Transform, and Load Data - Learning to clean, transform, join, and merge data sources in Power Query, and identify potential data anomalies by using data profiling tools.
- Capstone Project 2: Data Modeling in Power BI - Coming Soon
