# RStudio Biology Lab Projects

During my undergrad, I took a Biology II lab because I was required to, and at the beginning of the semester our TA warned us (via SpongeBob GIF) that we’d be using RStudio—and that none of us were gonna like it. He was right.

At the time, I didn’t have much programming experience. Even though I’d dabbled in different languages, I struggled to grasp the bigger picture of how a tool worked, its syntax, or why we wrote code a certain way.

## The Bio Lab Struggle Bus 
My TA (bless his anonymous heart) received many frantic emails from me when RStudio assignments were due—usually followed minutes later by a quippy subject line like:

- *“It’s me hi I’m the problem it’s me”*  
- *“Graphs (she's back)”*
- *"Guess who's back shady's back back again"*  

I mostly copied example code and changed things until it worked, but I couldn’t explain why we were using a certain graph, statistical test, or syntax. I was playing “Where’s Waldo” with code rather than learning to think like a programmer.

## Leveling Up With Python
About a year and a half later, after graduation, I decided to take up Python (again). This time, I had a secret weapon: my personal tutor, ChatGPT (affectionately called *Dr. Che-Gippit*).

The big breakthrough for me was **libraries**:
- You can download them like toolkits full of functions.  
- There are tons of them.  
- YouTube and documentation actually show you what they do.  

That unlocked everything. Suddenly, I could ask:
- “Why does this symbol mean what it does?”  
- “What if I wanted to use a different graph?”  
- “What happens if I change this parameter?”  

Instead of mimicking code blindly, I was actually learning how to *think* in a programming language.

## Why Revisit RStudio Now? 
For years, my experience with programming went like this:
- Dive into loops immediately.  
- Gloss over libraries.  
- Cry trying to install the coding environment.  
- Sit baffled at syntax quirks like “why is there an exclamation point there??”  
- Give up after too many vague answers like “you just kind of do it.”  

With AI as a tutor, I finally broke through that wall. So now, I’m revisiting my old Biology II RStudio projects—not to show off R expertise, but to demonstrate how my **thinking process** has evolved.  

This folder is about:
- Reviewing my old R code (plots, ANOVA/MANOVA, visualizations).  
- Applying what I now know about syntax, libraries, and structure.  
- Documenting the *questions I ask today* that I never knew to ask back then.

## Reflection
I may not use R every day, but coming back to it has shown me how transferable programming skills really are. Once you understand how to break problems down, use libraries, and ask the right questions—you can pick up any language.

Also: bless my TA. Really.
