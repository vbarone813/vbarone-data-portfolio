When I took that Bio Lab, my understanding of R and data analysis was too narrow to really understand what we were doing with the code and why, which made it hard to produce code in the first place 

I'm here to share what I've learned about R since then, so that maybe some poor Bio II student might better understand the language, the resouces available to them, and the broader picture of data analysis so that they can appraoch their assignments with greater clarity before they ever touch code. 

And then maybe the code will make more sense, too. 

Prayers.
